# Gradient-Generator
Mass generate images of gradients with custom colors and different dimensions and types.

To install the dependencies run `npm install`.

To run the program run `node index.js`.

Edit the size variable at top to change the dimensions.
Edit the colors to change the.. colors.
Edit the number in the for loop to change the number of images generated.

This is rough on RAM so take precautions.

I would make this configurable through a config file, but I'm lazy.
I'll do it later.

I assume no responsibility or liability for what you do with this.
Sure. You can use it for NFTs. I don't care.
